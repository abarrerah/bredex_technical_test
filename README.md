To start the project, the first thing to do is to start the docker with the database. You simply need Docker installed and run the command "docker-compose up -d". 
The dump.sql file contains the database needed to start the project.

Then we have to start both projects.
For Angular, we must access the Frontend folder and start the service with the command "ng serve -o".
For Spring, we must access the app folder and run the javac command to the AppApplication.java file in the src/main/java/abarrerah/app/AppApplication.java path.
